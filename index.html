                    I am a Junior computer science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of
                    Technology. Growing up, I’ve always had an interest in building and designing including both
                    software and hardware.

                <h2>Bright Minds Web Application</h2>
                <p>
                    One substantial project that I worked on during the summer of 2018 was the Bright Minds Learning Academy website application. Bright Minds Learning Academy is a private tutoring company whose owner asked me to design a modern looking website. The final product was a website application that uses a Cascading Style Sheet front end with a JavaScript back end. Additionally, the application uses a Firebase database to store and track email subscriptions, as seen in the purple “Newsletter” page.

                    One of the challenges I experienced while gathering requirements was that the client wasn’t a native English speaker and struggled to explain some of the features that she desired. To overcome this obstacle, I considered alternative forms of nonverbal communication. To understand my client’s needs, I prepared different front-end prototypes on a white board, where the client would be able to choose the design that she desired, even suggesting her own by drawing them on the board. Overall, gathering and detailing product requirements has improved my overall communication skills. Additionally, I was able to improve my coding and communication skills in an industrial environment.
