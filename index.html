                <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Junior Computer Science major. Growing up, I’ve always had an interest in building and
                    designing both software and hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Rose has taught me a lot with regards to technical experience, the most important skill
                    that I developed was the ability to learn and self-adapt. Computer Science has exploded during the
                    past few decades, and I am excited to utilize my new-found skills to tackle real world problems and
                    to learn and grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!

                <p>
                    As a first generation, nineteen-year-old Chinese American, I was raised in Canton, Ohio. In my
                    family, I have two loving parents, a younger sister, Angela, and a black and white shih tzhu dog,
                    Bruce. My mother is a web developer for the local government and my father is a Materials Manager at
                    Koch Knight LLC. During my time at Rose-Hulman, I have been provided with several opportunities to
                    learn and grow as an individual.

                <h2>Bright Minds Web Application</h2>
                <p>
                    Bright Minds Learning Academy is a private tutoring company whose owner asked me to design a modern
                    website. The final product was a website application that uses a Cascading Style Sheet and HTML
                    front end with a JavaScript back end. Additionally, the application uses a Firebase database to
                    store and track email subscriptions, as seen in the purple “Newsletter” page. When signed in as the
                    owner using Google Authentication, the owner can track grades, progress reports, and blog posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges I experienced while gathering product requirements was that the client wasn’t
                    a native English speaker and struggled to explain some of the features that she desired. Thus, to
                    understand my client’s needs, I prepared different front-end prototypes on a white board, where the
                    client would be able to choose the design that she desired, even suggesting her own by drawing them
                    on the board. Overall, being forced to gather product requirements in a partially nonverbal setting
                    has improved my overall communication skills, a quality that’s especially important in Product
                    Management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge I faced was having to serve as multiple roles in a Software Development team in
                    quick succession. For example, one moment, I was writing a function that retrieves information from
                    the database and the next moment, I was writing unit tests to test that function. Overall, since
                    this was my first major outside-of-the-classroom project, the experience has cemented my foundation
                    as a Software Engineer.

                <h2>Slot Machine</h2>
                <p>
                    For my Mechatronics class, my partner and I designed and implemented a standard slot machine using
                    two PIC18F4520 microcontrollers (each used to handle logical and mechanical systems), four Arduino
                    H-Bridge motor drivers, two sets of IR sensors, and four stepper motors. The slot machine’s
                    interface involves a single LED button next to a small slot that senses coin input. All outputs are
                    projected onto three 3D-Printed slot wheels that spun in random locations. The project was one of
                    the first electronic appliances I made: a foot-tall classic slot machine that took coin inputs and
                    outputted winnings depending on the given reel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming from a computer science background, I had almost no hardware experience. Overcoming this
                    challenge took hours of time spent in the laboratory learning electrical concepts, reading data
                    sheets, and testing circuits on a trial and error basis. During this process, I utilized whatever
                    resources I could find, including TA/Professor office hours, my roommate’s DC circuits textbook, and
                    YouTube videos. Not only has the experience has given me designing, building, and testing experience
                    with imbedded systems, but it has also improved my ability to self-learn, which involves asking good
                    questions and utilizing learning tools, a skill that is viable in industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the Slot Machine project has encouraged me to explore and interact with areas outside of my
                    comfort zone.
                </p>

                <h2>Food Compass</h2>
                <p>
                    For the Food Compass Challenge at the Indy Civic Challenge 2018, I worked with a team of three and
                    developed a static web application using HTML and CSS for the front end, JavaScript for the back
                    end, and Java for data scrubbing. The goal of the project was to provide a pertinent solution to the
                    food insecurity problem that afflicts Marion County and the city of Indianapolis. The web
                    application presents the user with a map of Marion County.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map is focused on Indianapolis, and features pins that correlate to various local and
                    state-based agencies. These points are linked to various local, charities, churches, and established
                    programs’ websites that can provide resources and assistance for those with food insecurity. The
                    checkbox can filter irrelevant, open and accessible agencies to the user, while the pins themselves
                    on the map provide a myriad of information, such as the name of the agency, its address, phone
                    number, website URL, distance, and relevant information regarding procedures and requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this was my team’s first hackathon, some of us had initial feelings of self-doubt: that our
                    lack of programming experience leaves us handicapped in creative potential. Although we were
                    initially self-doubtful, we developed into a strongly functioning team where each member could
                    incorporate their strengths in ways to finalize a usable product. This experience has taught me to
                    find ways to utilize my unique skillset to have a large impact on the project. Additionally, the
                    experience has strengthened my ability to work in a team, a skill that is pertinent to building
                    relationships with coworkers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Optimistically, my team and I believed that we produced a product that may provide a viable way to
                    aid the ailment of food insecurity in Indianapolis. At worst, we acquired a lot of experience, made
                    some new friends, and seized the opportunity to show support for the Indianapolis community at
                    large.
